        The Brindavan Gardens is a garden located 12 k.ms from the city of Mysore[1] in the Mandya District of the Indian State of Karnataka. It lies adjoining the Krishnarajasagara Dam which is built across the river Kaveri.[2] The work on laying out this garden
        was started in the year 1927 and completed in 1932.[3][4] Visited by close to 2 million tourists per year, the garden is one of the major attractions of Srirangapatna.[5] Sir Mirza Ismail, the Deewan of Mysore, a man with a penchant for gardens,
        founded the Brindavan Gardens (Krishnaraja Sagar Dam in particular) and built the Cauvery River high-level canal to irrigate 120,000 acres (490 km2) in modern Mandya district. He was inspired by Hyder Ali who had earlier built the Lalbagh Botanical
        Gardens at Bangalore.

    <h2>Garden</h2>
    <p class="example6">
        The garden is maintained by the Cauvery Niravari Nigama (Cauvery Irrigation Corporation), a Government of Karnataka enterprise.[6] It is spread across an area of 60 acres (240,000 m2). Adjoining it is also a fruit orchard spread across 75 acres (300,000
        m2) and 2 horticultural farms, Nagavana (30 acres) and Chandravana (5 acres).[7] The garden is laid out in 3 terraces which contain water fountains, Ficus trees, foliage plants such as Duranta plumaria and Euphorbia and flowering plants like Celosia,
        Marigold and bougainvillea.[4] The garden is open to the public and an entry-fee is charged. The garden also has topiary works (sculptures of animals created by clipping shrubs), pergolas (shaded passageway covered by creepers) and gazebos.[4]
        The main attraction of the park is the musical fountain in which bursts of water are synchronised to the music of songs. There is also a lake within the garden with boating facilities available for visitors.[8] The garden was renovated in 2005
        with a cost of Rs. 50 million.[9] The renovation included sprucing up the musical fountain using a digitised system and repairs of dysfunctional fountains.[9] In 2007, the Gardens were closed for a brief duration as a safety measure to avoid trouble
        related to the Cauvery water dispute.[10]
