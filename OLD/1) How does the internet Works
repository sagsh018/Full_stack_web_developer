1) Firstly we need to understand internet as a mean by which two computers kept at differnet location can talk
    to each other.
2) Now sometimes these computer are of two types:
    Client computer (where you sits and request for a web page)
    Server computer (where your request reach and get serverd)
3) Now suppose you typed in your browser the URL => www.google.com and hit enter
    Now firslty the request will go to your ISP's and through that to the DNS server, which will resolve the URL to
    its IP address and send it back to your computer.
4) Then your computer(client) make a direct request to the server via ISP's again and that request reaches the server 
    with the help of Internet backbone (big wire).
5) the server return the requested web page to the client using the same internet backbone.
6) Now this is a brief overview of internet.
