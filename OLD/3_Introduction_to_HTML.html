# The Anatomy of an HTML tag
============================

1) <h1>Hello world</h1>
    here <h1> : is called starting tag
         </h1> : called closing tag
         in the middle we have content we want to apply these tags to.
            <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
            <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
            <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
            <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
            <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
            <h6>Heading level 6</h6>
2) <br> : line break tag
            also called as self closing tags
3) <hr> : horizontal rule 
            another example of self closing tags, used to create the horizontal lines.
4) <hr size="3"> : Horizontal rule alonwg with an attribute
                    size="3" is basically an attribute to this HTML tag and hr is HTML element and these HTML
                    attrinutes modify the HTML attributes,
    We can have a look at the information regarding the available attributes for a perticular HTML tag at the
    HTML documentation

    NOTE :: Also if you are not sure about something on a web page, we can always right click and inspect that element
            and it can give the information about the HTML, CSS and Javascript code used to create that document.
    
    <hr size="3" noshade> : this one is having two attributes.
5) <center></center> : used to centralized the entire content in the webpage.

6) Have a look at the sample html codebelow for this lecture as :
        -->
<center>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <h1>The Adventures of <br> Sherlock Holmes</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>by</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
</center>
