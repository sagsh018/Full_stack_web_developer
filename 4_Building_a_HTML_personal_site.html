                    1) <em></em> : this is emphasis on the text inside these tags and conver them into italics
                    2) <i></i> : to just add the style and does not emphasis.
                    So better practice is to use <em> tag
    
                    The similar kind of pair is 
                    1) <b></b> : This again just style the text and convert it into bold
                    2) <strong></strong> : This tag convert text into bold but also gives meaning and thats why conver it into bold.
                    So again better to use this one.

    <!-- Now we will add the images to our HTML page 
        Notes:
            a) image tag <img> is a self closing tag
            b) along with the image tag we have to provide the source of the image. and this image could be a image URL or the local image on 
                the local system
            c) for Online image URL => https://scontent.fdel33-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p160x160/52961230_2102800463100481_5485985113277726720_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&_nc_sid=dbb9e7&_nc_ohc=ygF_cRrvATEAX96AAMM&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel33-1.fna&tp=6&oh=2117b57cff61ef1ea864aba0c4f95293&oe=5F9FBA69
            d) Notice that we will be including the img tag at the top of our web page that is just above the level-1 heading 
            e) Now the second method to include the image is to have it in the local system and add that path to the image tag for src 
                attribute. This image we will add at the bottom of the page. see below
                note that we can keep the local image only in under the root of our web project folder where our .html 
                file exist.

    <!-- Tables in HTML

    <table border="1">
        <!--notice that all the styling attributes in HTML for table are deprecated and we are only making use of the CSS to style to portion of tables-->

    <!--
        Notice above inside the table tag, we have divided the table into three parts
        1) table header -- thead
        2) table body -- tbody
        3) table footer -- tfoot
        We require these seggregation in order to apply different styles and color codes using CSS.

        Note
        ====
        Inside the table tag we are just creating the tables rows and inside those rows we are filling up the data 
        cell by cell, which is effectively creating the columns. 
        with the help of this functionality we could keep two things side by side in HTML page.
        for example, we have kept the image at the starting along with the intro side by side with the help
        of table

        Now we will create a table of skills we have along with the rating based on how expert we are in that skill

        look at the meraki.html page to have better insite of that page. So here in this web page we have added the 
        link to meraki.html for the intro paragraph have description about me.
        secondly we are going to create another link with the name service provided, and that will also lead to the
