    <p><em>Founder & Devops Developer at <strong><a href="meraki.html">MERAKI</a></strong></em></p>
    <!-- paraghrap tag, this adds one line break by default. now here in this paragraph tag there are two ways to convert the test to italics
        1) <em></em> : this is emphasis on the text inside these tags and conver them into italics
        2) <i></i> : to just add the style and does not emphasis.
        So better practice is to use <em> tag
    
        The similar kind of pair is 
        1) <b></b> : This again just style the text and convert it into bold
        2) <strong></strong> : This tag convert text into bold but also gives meaning and thats why conver it into bold.
        So again better to use this one.

    <!-- Now we will add the images to our HTML page 
        Notes:
            a) image tag <img> is a self closing tag
            b) along with the image tag we have to provide the source of the image. and this image could be a image URL or the local image on 
                the local system
            c) for Online image URL => https://scontent.fdel33-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p160x160/52961230_2102800463100481_5485985113277726720_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&_nc_sid=dbb9e7&_nc_ohc=ygF_cRrvATEAX96AAMM&_nc_ht=scontent.fdel33-1.fna&tp=6&oh=2117b57cff61ef1ea864aba0c4f95293&oe=5F9FBA69
            d) Notice that we will be including the img tag at the top of our web page that is just above the level-1 heading 
            e) Now the second method to include the image is to have it in the local system and add that path to the image tag for src 
                attribute. This image we will add at the bottom of the page. see below
                note that we can keep the local image only in under the root of our web project folder where our .html 
                file exist.
            -->
    <!--<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Local profile picture">-->


    <!-- Next we will proceed with the HTML links and anchor tags. Anchor tag is basically used to add the hyper link
        to our document. and this is a portion which explains HTML's, HT(Hyper Text) part.
        syntax <a href="URL">URL name to be displayed on page</a>
        
        We willl be implementing this anchor tag at many places in this website page. Look at the code for anchor
        tag and try to understand its usage
    -->

    <!--
        To create our own different html page and adding th link to that page in thim main file of our
        So for this we will create another file called as meraki.html at the same level as that of other html file
        from where we are going to call this html page.

        look at the meraki.html page to have better insite of that page. So here in this web page we have added the 
        link to meraki.html for the intro paragraph have description about me.
        secondly we are going to create another link with the name service provided, and that will also lead to the 
        same page. see below
    -->
    <h3><a href="4.2_meraki.html">Services</a></h3>
    <!--
        Suppose we want to create another page for contact details so that anyone can contact me from the main page
        file created => contact_details.html. see below the call to my contact details page
    -->
    <h3><a href="4.1_contact_details.html">Contact Us</a></h3>
</body>

</html>

<!--
    Notice that in the above code we have writtin first the basic code and we can also get it as a template(also called boiler
    plate) with the help of !+tab. Note that we are getting it with the help of shortcut from emmet. To see all the
    shortcuts go to below ling
