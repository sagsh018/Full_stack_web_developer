1) So as we have discussed in previous lecture how we recieve the web pages from the servers kept at remote locations
    with the help of internet.
2) now the web page/websites that we look at our computer(client) and recieved from server are usually made up of three
    languages
    a) HTML - Used to provide structure to your web page
    b) CSS - Used for styling the web page and beautify internet
    c) Javascript - Responsible for your web page actually behaves. i.e. how it actually works
